## Deleting content
Each workshop user created at least one project.  We need to make sure that these projects are not there for next group of users.  Unfortunately we cannot just create new users as we need to remove all the resources each workshop participant provisioned.  We will have to remove:
1. projects
2. Forms
3. Form Themes

## Removing Projects

``
note: If you are logged in already, you can open a new browser window in incognito mode or select the user icon in the top right and select Logout.
``

You will see the projects you have shared with the user account and any projects the workshop participant created.
